# Orbital parameters joint fit for a binary star system
Astrometry+RV joint fit implementation for a binary system using the framework of exoplanet. exoplanet is a toolkit for probabilistic modeling of transit and/or radial velocity observations of exoplanets and other astronomical time series using PyMC3. PyMC3 is a flexible and high-performance model building language and inference engine that scales well to problems with a large number of parameters. 

exoplanet extends PyMC3â€™s language to support many of the custom functions and distributions required when fitting exoplanet datasets. Details and documentation of exoplanet package can be found in  https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/stable/
